# AppleScript-Folder-to-PDF
This AppleScript converts all files in a specified folder to PDF, naming the resulting PDF after the folder. It uses AppleScript for file handling and shell scripting for conversion. The script processes each file based on its type and uses command-line tools for PDF generation. ImageMagick must be installed for this script to function properly.
